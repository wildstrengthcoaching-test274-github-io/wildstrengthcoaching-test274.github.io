This is an example for an editable.
Tell the client where this is located, and let him/her edit just this file.
Drop it into the main page via {% include /editables/editables.html %}.
You can add as many files as you want in the editables folder and include them in this way.
This is great for example for upcoming dates that need regular change that the client him/herself wants to update,
or for similar scenarios.

Are you a Web Developer and using OneFlow to build a site for a client?
If the client him/herself regularly wants to change certain parts of the site, for example upcoming dates,
OneFlow offers easy editables within Jekyll's <code>/_includes</code> folder, so the client does not have to touch
the rest of the site, but can still edit whatever he/she needs to edit.
